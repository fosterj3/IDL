# Executive Summary 
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) considers people spending more than 30% of their income on housing as housing burdened. Housing costs include rent, mortgage payement, property taxes, utilities, and housing insurance (Lin, 2018). There has recently been a spotlight on how energy prices, i.e. utilities, contribute to housing burden (Buylova, 2020). Energy bills of more than 6-10% of income is considered unaffordable (Hernandez & Bird, 2010; Heindl, 2015; Kontokosta et al., 2019). Previous research demonstrates energy cost burden disproportionately affect lower income households, largely because they are most at risk for living in substandard and inefficient housing (Hernandez & Phillips, 2015). Energy upgrades can  help alleviate enerrgy cost burden and potentially housing burden by saving a low-income multifamily household up to $1,500 per year per household (Kontokosta et al., 2019).

Energy cost burden is a function of both income and energy consumption. Drehobl and Ross (2016) found that an average low-income household energy burden was 7.2%, which is higher than an average higher income household energy burden of 2.3%. Findings from an evaluation of a federal energy assistance program determiined that low-income households represent 92% of all households with energy burden of 10% (APPRISE, 2005). Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) designs its funding distribution mechanism based on energy burden levels. Income is used as the main qualifier for this program.

Buyolva (2020) used two datasets: a household energy audit survey - the residential building stock assessment (RBSA) completed by the Northwest Energy Efficiency Association (NEEA) in 2017 and the American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2017 5-year estimates data to investigate the dynamics between energy use and socio-demographic characteristics in spatial modeling of residential energy consumption.

# Data Description 

This data is from the Residential Building Stock Assessment [(RBSA)](https://neea.org/resources/rbsa-ii-combined-database) conducted in 2016-17. It has 47 comma separated variable (csv) tabular datasets that includes a representative sample of 1,130 single-family, 230 multi-family and 550 manufactured homes gathered across the Northwest region. For the single-family component, participants are recruited based on a random selection of single-family residential USPS addresses. For the multi-family component, the study recruited multi-family buildings to participate in the study and then identify tenants in those buildings willing to participate. Two auditors performed each site visit. Audits lasted approximately two hours and covered all of the major components of the homes that can be linked to the household’s overall energy use, including: building envelope, HVAC systems, lighting, appliances, electronics, and water technologies. In addition, this audit data was combined with self-reported home characteristics and demographics data that were collected in the phone survey during the recruitment of on-site sample. Supporting documentation of the RBSA data can be found [here](https://neea.org/data/residential-building-stock-assessment).

The RBSA database is comprised of a 49 files: 47 csv files, one .txt ReadMe, and an excel spreadsheet with unique database values. One of the csv tables is a data dictionary that gives a description of the column names in each csv table. The size of the csv files ranges from 2 KB to 16.6 MB. The smallest table contains 11 columns and 14 rows/observations, while the largest table contains 249 columns and 15561 rows/observations. The ReadMe details updates and changes to the RBSA II Database; changes and updates are numbered and organized by date. Each row in a table has a unique primary key (PK), making it possible to reference that specific object, and may include other relational keys (CKs) that make it possible to relate to other tables in the database. Most tables can be joined using the CK_SiteID and the CK_RoomID.

The RBSA database houses data for manufactured homes, single-family homes, multi-family residences, and multi-family buildings. Within the database, data are attributed to a Site or a Building. Building data include information collected for nonresidential portions of a multifamily building. Site data include information collected for the entirety of a single-family or manufactured home, and for residences visited at a multifamily building. The database denotes data associated with a Site by a CK_SiteID or PK_SiteID beginning with “SITE”; the database denotes data associated with a Building by a CK_SiteID or PK_SiteID beginning with “BLDG.”

1) Accuracy 
  i) How well does a piece of information reflect reality?
  
2) Completenes 
  i) Does it fulfill your expectations of what’s comprehensive?
  
3) Consistency 
  i) Does information stored in one place match relevant data stored elsewhere?
  
4) Timeliness 
  i) Is your information available when you need it?
  
5) Validity 
  i) Is information in a specific format, does it follow business rules, or is it in an unusable format?
  
6) Uniqueness 
  i) Is this the only instance in which this information appears in the database?

#Data Cleaning 

## Check summary of data
summary()

## Missing values overall
sum(is.na(pug_short))

## Missing values by columns
colSums(is.na(pug_short))

##Turn Certain variables into factors 
pug_short_clean <- pug_short %>% 
  mutate(across(c(`Home Type - FMP Detailed`, `Primary Heating System`,`Home Type - Final`,`Reported Income`:Ownership),as.factor)) 

# Check certain variables 
summary(pug_short_clean$`Reported Income`) 
```

There are zero NAs in the data set, however there are observations coded as "prefer not to say" and "unknown." The variables coded as "prefer not to say" and "unknown" will be recoded at NAs

There are 27 unique "reported income."  Future researchers may want to consider a binary variable that denotes whether a household is making a low wage based on their annual income.

Make age variable with three levels 
  0 -18 
  19-64
  65 and older 

Make another "Qty of Occupants" variable that is categorical with four levels 
  one-person
  two-person
  three-person
  four or more
