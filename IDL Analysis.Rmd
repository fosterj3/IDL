This data is from the Residential Building Stock Assessment [https://neea.org/resources/rbsa-ii-combined-database](RBSA) conducted in 2016-17. It includes a representative sample of single-family, Multi-family and manufactured homes gathered across the Northwest region. Whenever possible, data was collected in a similar manner as the 2011 â€“ 2012 assessment to ensure continuity and comparability between the studies. Supporting documentation of the RBSA data can be found [https://neea.org/data/residential-building-stock-assessment](here).
