# Executive Summary
This documentation outlines the preprocessing of RBSA data to reproduce the analytical data frame and model as described in the Buylova (2020) "Spotlight on energy efficiency in Oregon" article. Buyolva (2020) used two data sets: a household energy audit survey - the residential building stock assessment (RBSA) completed by the Northwest Energy Efficiency Association (NEEA) in 2017 and the American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2017 5-year estimates data to investigate the dynamics between energy use and socio-demographic characteristics in spatial modeling of residential energy consumption. This documentation is focused on preprocessing the RBSA data.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) considers people spending more than 30% of their income on housing as housing burdened. Housing costs include rent, mortgage payment, property taxes, utilities, and housing insurance (Lin, 2018). There has recently been a spotlight on how energy prices, i.e. utilities, contribute to housing burden (Buylova, 2020). Energy bills of more than 6-10% of income is considered unaffordable (Hernandez & Bird, 2010; Heindl, 2015; Kontokosta et al., 2019). Previous research demonstrates energy cost burden disproportionately affect lower income households, largely because they are most at risk for living in substandard and inefficient housing (Hernandez & Phillips, 2015). Energy upgrades can  help alleviate energy cost burden and potentially housing burden by saving a low-income multifamily household up to $1,500 per year per household (Kontokosta et al., 2019).

Energy cost burden is a function of both income and energy consumption. Drehobl and Ross (2016) found that an average low-income household energy burden was 7.2%, which is higher than an average higher income household energy burden of 2.3%. Findings from an evaluation of a federal energy assistance program determined that low-income households represent 92% of all households with energy burden of 10% (APPRISE, 2005). Federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) designs its funding distribution mechanism based on energy burden levels. Income is used as the main qualifier for this program.

## Section 1: Data Description

### Key Steps

1) Explored and discovered existing data documentation 
2) Identified data frames of interest 
3) Discerned relationship between data frames 

This data is from the Residential Building Stock Assessment [(RBSA)](https://neea.org/resources/rbsa-ii-combined-database) conducted in 2016-17. It includes a representative sample of single-family, multi-family and manufactured homes gathered across the Northwest region. It has 47 comma separated variable (csv) tabular data sets that includes a representative sample of 1,130 single-family, 230 multi-family and 550 manufactured homes gathered across the Northwest region. For the single-family component, participants are recruited based on a random selection of single-family residential USPS addresses. For the multi-family component, the study recruited multi-family buildings to participate in the study and then identify tenants in those buildings willing to participate. Two auditors performed each site visit. Audits lasted approximately two hours and covered all of the major components of the homes that can be linked to the household’s overall energy use, including: building envelope, HVAC systems, lighting, appliances, electronics, and water technologies. In addition, this audit data was combined with self-reported home characteristics and demographics data that were collected in the phone survey during the recruitment of on-site sample. Supporting documentation of the RBSA data can be found [here](https://neea.org/data/residential-building-stock-assessment).

The RBSA database is comprised of a 49 files: 47 csv files, one .txt ReadMe, and an excel spreadsheet with unique database values. One of the csv tables is a data dictionary that gives a description of the column names in each csv table. The size of the csv files ranges from 2 KB to 16.6 MB. The smallest table contains 11 columns and 14 rows/observations, while the largest table contains 249 columns and 15561 rows/observations. The ReadMe details updates and changes to the RBSA II Database; changes and updates are numbered and organized by date. Each row in a table has a unique primary key (PK), making it possible to reference that specific object, and may include other relational keys (CKs) that make it possible to relate to other tables in the database. Most tables can be joined using the CK_SiteID and the CK_RoomID.

The RBSA database houses data for manufactured homes, single-family homes, multi-family residences, and multi-family buildings. Within the database, data are attributed to a Site or a Building. Building data include information collected for nonresidential portions of a multifamily building. Site data include information collected for the entirety of a single-family or manufactured home, and for residences visited at a multifamily building. The database denotes data associated with a Site by a CK_SiteID or PK_SiteID beginning with “SITE”; the database denotes data associated with a Building by a CK_SiteID or PK_SiteID beginning with “BLDG.”

## Section 2: Data Journey

### Key Steps

1) Identified and merged data frames of interest
3) Subset the data for region of interest
4) Explored data and selected variables of interest
    a) explanatory variables based on Buylova paper
5) Recoded and reclassified data
6) Transformed variables of interest
7) Created EUI variable (response variable)


The data cleaning and wrangling process followed basic data quality checks, which included assessing the data for 1) accuracy, 2) completeness, 3) consistency, 4) timeliness, 5) validity, and 6) uniqueness (refer to Appendix A for detailed information regarding this assessment). All of the data cleaning and wrangling took place in R Studio, using base R and tidyverse syntax. The first step in the cleaning process involved identifying useful data sets. The "One Line Summary" and "Site Interview Demographics" data frames were used to create the analytic data set. The data cleaning and wrangling was driven by trying to replicate the analysis done in the [Buylova (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421520301920) paper. Dplyr from the tidyverse was used to merge the "One Line Summary" to the "Site Interview Demographics" data frames.The "One Line Summary" data frame has data concerning energy consumption, geographic location, and building information. The primary key for the merger were the "DB_SiteID" and "CK_SiteID." The "Site Interview Demographics" data frame included demographic information, such as resident's income, age, and ownership status (renter or buyer). 

After the merger, the data frame was subsetted for for the "Puget Sound" region. Next, housing variables and household characteristic variables, as outlined by the Buylova (2020) paper, were selected for the analytical data frame (refer to Appendix B to learn more about the housing and household characteristic variables). The EUI, the response variable, was created by dividing the total energy consumption in British Thermal Units (kBTU) by the conditioned living area of the home (sq. foot). To do this, variables with kBTU units were identified and used in the analytic data set. Once the analytic data frame had all the necessary variables, it was checked for missingness. 

The first attempt of checking for missing data resulted in there being zero missing data. Upon further examination, it was revealed that missing data in the RBSA data set were coded as "unknown" or "prefer not to say." Variables with those observations were recoded as NA (missing). To replicate the Buylova (2020) model, many variables needed to be transformed, such as age variables, income variables, and the total occupants variable. Finally, the "janitor" package was used to make all of the variables lowercase and if applicable snake case. 

```{r}
#Merge ols_df to demog
  ols_demog <- left_join(ols_df, demog, by = c("DB_SiteID" = "CK_SiteID"))
```

```{r}
# Only get sites in Puget Sound Region
pug_sound_ols <- ols_demog %>%
  filter(Region == "Puget Sound")
```

```{r}
#Explore the Puget Sound Data
sum(is.na((pug_sound_ols)))
```

```{r}
#Select variables of interest
pug_short <- pug_sound_ols %>%
  select(`Cadmus ID`, State, County,Region, `Home Type - FMP Detailed`, `Home Type - Final`, `Year Built`,`Primary Heating System`, `Qty Bedrooms`,`Reported Income`, `Do you own or rent your home`, Ownership, `Qty Occupants Between 65 Years or Older`, `Qty Occupants Between Less than 1 Year`, `Qty Occupants Between 6 and 10 Years`, `Qty Occupants.x`, `Qty Occupants.y`, `Qty Occupants Between Less than 1 Year`, `Qty Occupants Between 1 and 5 Years`, `Qty Occupants Between 6 and 10 Years`, `Qty Occupants Between 11 and 18 Years`, `Qty Occupants Between 19 and 45 Years`, `Qty Occupants Between 46 and 64 Years`, `Qty Occupants Between 65 Years or Older`, `Conditioned Area`, `Annual Electric Usage (kBtu)`)

## Section 3: Data Assessment

### Key Steps

1) Reading literature of data ethics 
2) Exploring data for identifiability 
3) Identifying potential data mergers that may raise privacy concerns

Data is not neutral. Data is used to convey a narrative about individuals, organizations, institutions, and the environment. As a result, data has the power to shape people's worldview and influence their decisions. The depth of and breadth of the RBSA data provides researchers and analyst with a myriad of analytical options and narratives they can tell. While data ought to be public and democratized, within reason, it can lead to bad actors using data to reify inequities. Users of the RBSA data should be mindful of the narrative they are telling with their data analysis and how their analysis can potentially be used to do harm. 

Identifiability is becoming less of a binary and more of a continuum. In other words, privacy is not about private or public, but about how much information is disclosed, which in turn can make certain groups and individuals more seen. The RBSA is publicly available data that does not disclose individual addresses or people's names. However, a person's zip code, type of house, annual income, and the age of the homeowners/residents can result in individual houses becoming more identifiable. Disclosure risks increase with dimensionality (more variables), linking multiple data sources, and using data analytics. This may run the risk of not adequately protecting vulnerable groups in the data set. For example, if this data is merged with other data sets, someone can identify households that are comprised of only elderly people or single people. This is a cause for concern for these vulnerable groups. Geospatial analyses need to be done with care to mitigate the potential for identifying people.

## Section 4: Modeling

### Key Steps

- What analyses can be done with the data 
- What models were built 

```{r}
#model  
lm(eui ~ conditioned_area, data = pug_eui)

lm(eui ~ home_type_final + primary_heating_system + qty_bedrooms + elderly + children + household_size + ownership, data = pug_eui) %>%
  summary()
```

## Section 5: Future work

### Key Steps

- What further questions can be asked with the data?
- What other data sets could complement or replace these data?
- What methods could be applied to answer the aforementioned questions and work with the aforementioned data sets?  
- What software, languages, and tools would be needed to answer the aforementioned questions and work with aforementioned data sets?
- What resources and/or areas of expertise would be valuable for others interested in working with the data?

The RBSA data exploration was guided by how Bulova(2020) used the RBSA data to invesitgate the dynamics between energy use and socio-demographic characteristics in spatial modeling of residential energy consumption. Buylova's investigation was done by merging the RBSA data with ACS data. It has yet to be seen what other data sources can be used alongside the RBSA data set and what questions can be answered. This section makes an attempt to imagine innovative approaches to using the RBSA data set to answer relevant and critical questions. 

The RBSA data could potentially be paired with housing data, such as Washington Merged Longitudinal Adminstrative Data [(WMLAD)](https://uwescience.github.io/MinWA/Overview/) or [Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/) data to illustrative a clearer picture of housing burden in Washington State of specifically the Puget Sound region. Most studies on housing burden typically exclude energy costs when calculating housin burden. RBSA data can create a new latent construct for housing burden that may have policy implications.
